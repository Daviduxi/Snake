<h3 align="center"> 🍎🍏 Classic snake game done with C!! 🍎🍏 </h3>

>[!NOTE]
>This was the final project for the first year of programming with C. So the code may have some nuances that need to be improved, or some functions made less optimal at the direct request of the work instructions.

>[!WARNING]
>VSC has a few problems with running C programs, so at university we used the Pelles C program.

>[!TIP]
>I recommend using a similar application, or if possible, the same one. To avoid file or library corruption.

<h3 align="left"> ▶ How to play! 🎮🕹️</h3>

- Move the snake with the arrows (←↑↓→)
- You die when you touch or crash into one of the edges. The goal is to get the maximum number of points, which you get by surviving and eating apples.
- Every so often, objects appear: an apple that adds points, and an X that kills you. So be careful with the spawns at all times.

<h3 align="left"> ▶ The code is composed of two files: </h3>

- main → Contains the main body of the code, only with the calling of functions to optimize with the least number of lines of code.
- library → Contains all the functions that are called in the main file, the purpose of functions is to clearly separate all parts of the code, so that any part of the code can be easily reused or modified.
